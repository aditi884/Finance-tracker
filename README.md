**# ✍️ Simple Command-Line To-Do App

A clean and intuitive command-line application built with Python for managing your daily tasks. This tool is perfect for anyone who wants a straightforward way to keep track of their to-do list without a complex graphical interface.

🚀 Key Features
Effortless Task Management: Add new tasks with a single line of input.
Persistent Storage: All your tasks are automatically saved to a local tasks.txt file, ensuring your to-do list is always there when you need it.
Clear Status Tracking: View your tasks with a simple [ ] for pending tasks and [x] for completed ones.
Simple Task Manipulation: Easily mark tasks as complete or delete them from your list using their corresponding number.
⚙️ How It Works
This application demonstrates fundamental Python concepts by using a class to represent each task and handling file I/O to read from and write to a text file. This keeps the data safe and persistent across different sessions.

▶️ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Ensure you have a recent version of Python installed on your system.
Execution
Clone this repository to your local machine.

This is a basic command-line to-do list manager written in C++. It's a great project for understanding fundamental C++ concepts like classes, objects, file I/O streams, and dynamic memory management. The application allows you to organize your tasks and saves your data for future use.

⚙️ Key Features
Task Class: Defines a Task as an object with a description and a completion status.
File Persistence: Tasks are automatically loaded from and saved to a tasks.txt file using C++ file streams (fstream).
User-Friendly Interface: A clear menu guides you through adding, viewing, and managing tasks.
Robust Input Handling: The program handles various user inputs to prevent crashes and ensure a smooth experience.
🚀 How to Run
Prerequisites
A C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
Compilation
Navigate to the src directory in your terminal.
Compile the source code using your C++ compiler:
g++ main.cpp -o todo_app
Execution
Run the compiled executable:
./todo_app
Follow the prompts to interact with the application.
📋 Sample Output
When you run the application for the first time, it will start with an empty list.
